        <p1>The Republic Act 9344, also known as the "Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006" in the Philippines, is a law that focuses on the treatment and rehabilitation of children in conflict with the law. Here are key points about R.A. 9344:</p1>
<p>1.Purpose: The law aims to promote a child-friendly justice system that ensures the well-being of children in conflict with the law. It recognizes the vulnerability of children and their potential for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>2.Age of Criminal Responsibility: R.A. 9344 raised the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 9 to 15 years old. Children below 15 years old are deemed as having discernment and are, therefore, exempted from criminal liability.
</p>
<p>3.Diversion Programs: The law encourages the use of diversion programs rather than punitive measures. It emphasizes rehabilitation and reintegration into society for children in conflict with the law.
</p>
<p>4Juvenile Justice and Welfare Council (JJWC): The JJWC is established to oversee the implementation of the law and ensure the protection of the rights of the child throughout the judicial process.
</p>
<p>5.Child Detention Facilities: R.A. 9344 mandates the establishment of separate detention facilities for children in conflict with the law, ensuring that they are not detained with adult offenders.
</p>
<p>As the implementation of the law evolves, the impact on the lives of juvenile offenders is likely to resonate far beyond the confines of legal proceedings, creating a ripple effect of positive change in the landscape of juvenile justice.
